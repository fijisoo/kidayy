And here comes Shame with their need to make me feel ashamed about my poor and boring life. Their ability to share emotions reminds me somehow that everything I'm struggling with is just a wall behind which lays all desires. So I can tell you that today is a snow day here, and I listened to their "Harsh Degrees" (shame that wasn't Snow Day!) and that music pushed me - an almost 30 years old guy - to go sledding. And I realized that there is no need to worry much about everything. You know... sometimes the best option is just to let everything go as it comes to you. Collect all experiences as it was in your childhood. Be curious even about the same things but test them on different age levels. I really appreciate such impulses in my life. There should be more of that. Wish Shame great :)

Best track on the new album: 6/1 with transition to the next one. 

[Here's also stream from personalized copy signing event. They also laughed at my `joke` about ](https://youtu.be/FHmZAGE0xjk?t=28153)*["Josh looks like he's doin' maths or smth." (7:49:13)](https://youtu.be/FHmZAGE0xjk?t=28153)* 

Thanks Shame, you made me a huge smile too!
